My favorite 3 GIT Bash commands:

1. CODE .
   It allows you to open your code editor in any file you want without using mouse.Fast and cool!

2. NANO
   It allows you to write text to any file you want without opening a file on desktop.

3. GIT LOG -P
   You can see any changes -including past- and any content of the particular file.
