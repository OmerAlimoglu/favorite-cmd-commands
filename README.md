My favorite 3 GIT Bash commands:

## CODE .
   It allows you to open your code editor in any file you want without using mouse.*Fast* and *cool!*

## NANO
   It allows you to write text without opening the file on desktop.

## GIT LOG -P
   You can see any changes -including past- and any content of the particular file.
